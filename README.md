# jtaghal
JTAG Hardware Abstraction Library

Provides an object-oriented interface to JTAG-accessible devices, JTAG adapters, and so on. Intended to be easily
extensible so that applications can add support for custom in-system debug features on FPGAs, etc.

This repo contains the library only, and no client application code or standalone build system.

Most users should probably use azonenberg/jtaghal-cmake and not this repo.
